**Recruitment Automation Project version 1.1.1d**

**Update Notes:**

- Specific designation of Debian compatability
- Updated license
--------------------------

**What it does:**
The Recruitment Automation Project complies a list of new nations from NationStates and inputs them into a link that you can copy. Additionally, it places your recruitment template into the link, meaning one less click for you to make. It also pads the generation time to give you the proper amount of time between link generations. For example, if a link for 4 nations is generated, at least 40 seconds will elapse before the next link is generated.

**How to start:**
Simply download the file off github, open it, and follow the prompts. If you download the .zip file (recommended), you'll need to decompress the file as well. For Debian platforms, make sure that you run the file in the terminal; otherwise, it will not open. Once you are finished recruiting, you can simply close the prompt. It is *highly* recommended that you place the recruitment file in a separate folder from other files and documnets prior to running.

**What do to if something breaks:**
No worries! Code goes haywire all the time. If you have issues with running the code, pause and wait a while to see if the problem relates to your computer, internet, or the NS servers. If not, contact the developer at Lies Kryos#1734 on Discord. With the introduction of logging, you can also find the .log file at "recruitment_automation_logging.log", which should be in the same directory as the executable file. 

**Why the verification?**
Verification is required, plain and simple. It protects you (the user), me (the developer), and the benefitting party (the region you are using your recruitment for). If something goes horribly wrong and the program is abused, hopefully verification will keep the damage minimal.

**License:**
All users are permitted to download and use a copy of the code included in the program. However, the All Rights Reserved license means that all rights, including that of altering and distributing the code, are reserved completely and without exception to Lies Kryos. No other person is permitted to make alterations, distribute copies, or sell this code under any circumstances.
